Basic idealogy:
The requests to server from client would contain a command in 'one' field of protobuf that gets executed in the terminal and send back its response.
There are 4 rpc services
1. commandService : To set commands in database. A uid must be send along with the command.
2. getCommandsService : To get commands from database. A uid can be send along with the request to indicate last command that was recieved by the client. The 'five' in response of commandService contains uidLatest. If null, it waits for new command to arrive and that is sent.
3. sendResponse : To send Response
4. getResponse : To get Response
# Files structure:
remoteFunctions.py contains remote functions to be called.
server.py is server file
client.py is client file
comProto defines protocol buffer
comProto_pb2.py and comProto_pb2_grpc.py are autogenerated files.

Note:
